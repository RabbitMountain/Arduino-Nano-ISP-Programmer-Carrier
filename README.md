(Rabbit Mountain Research) AVR Arduino Pro Micro & Arduino Pro Mini ISP programmers
========================

This shield / carrier board, once assembled, turns your Arduino Pro Mini or Pro Micro into an ISP programmer. The ISP socket is wired to work directly with the ArduinoISP code.

Currently I am having trouble getting the pro micro version to work. The Pro Mini version works with a capacitor wired to the reset pin, but may interfere with uploading new arduino sketches.

This board was designed to replace my old legacy TinyISP programmer from Adafruit (which no longer works easily with Ubuntu Linux).
